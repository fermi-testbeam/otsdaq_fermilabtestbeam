CC-USB Firmware release information

**** ccusb_4503.bit 04/11/05


**** ccusb_7504.bit 07/01/05
1.user inputs and outputs new defined:
		I1 - trigger + 24-bit trigger counter
		I2 - Scaler (24-bit) is read from register 18 and is 
		     cleared by writing bit 3 (8) to Action Register.
		I3 - I3 is a pseudo-coincidence-register. It is read as LAM(24) - most significant
		     bit of the LAM register. It can substitute for hit register bit#15 when bit 4 (16) 
		     is set in global register. When hit register is read as the first Camac word, 
		     its most significant bit is replaced at S1 time by the state of the I3 input. 
		     Which means that the user can condition readout of individual modules by the state
		     of I1 at S1 time during the readout of a hit register.
		O1 - busy
		O2 - internal event trigger
		O3 - end of busy
2. Register 16 (read-only) contains number of events in a run. It is cleared at the beginning of a run.
3. There are now separate multiplexers for LEDs and NIM outputs.
4. O1 default is busy, O2 default is Event trigger, O3 default is End of event


**** ccusb_0101.bit 09/28/05
1. Internal Register addressing changed to CAMAC style (N25) (with the exception of the Action Register)
2. The Register Block is reduced to Action register, with additional bit being now active 
	(bit 4 triggers scaler readout while in acquisition mode)
3. two Delay Gate Generators and two Scalers.
4. Mixing of regular events and scaler events in a data buffer
5. Two new modes of triggering the scaler readout while in data acquisition mode,
	for a total of three modes:
	a) Event-count based trigger
	b) Timer-based trigger (1/2 s - 127.5 s) 
	c) Interactive trigger (by writing 1 to bit 4 of the Action Register)
