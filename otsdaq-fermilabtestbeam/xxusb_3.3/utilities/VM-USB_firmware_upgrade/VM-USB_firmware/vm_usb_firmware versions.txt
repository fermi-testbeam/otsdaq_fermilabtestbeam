Firmware 86000801 has an improved handling of bus arbitration and IRQ handling. It allows one to handle 
multi-master systems more reliably than the older firmware. 
It is a recommended  update, as it has a potentially harmful bug removed. The highlight are as follows:

1.	Several masters can handle IRQs, as the individual masters can mask out IRQ levels that are to be handled 
	by other masters.
2.	Non-slot 1 VM-USB can handle IRQs.
3.	Removed a bug that had the potential to cause problems in multi-master systems utilizing IRQs – 
  	the IRQ process did not arbitrate for bus during IACK stage. Now it does.
